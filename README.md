## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The prompt that started this project was the following: 

```
Create a small Python application following state-of-the-art standards and best practices in terms of craftsmanship.

Using FastAPI, expose these endpoints:

/temperature: what will be the temperature in Lisbon in 3 days?
/rain: Will it rain in Lisbon in 3 days?
This should be reflecting real data, fetched from any API of your choice.

Ensure the application is unit tested correctly and is overall built to be highly maintainable. A README is a must.
```


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


### Installing

The steps to install the project are the following:

1. Ensure python3 is installed, as well as pip.

2. Install all requirements by running the following command on the root folder of the repository.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the environment variables: WEATHER_API_URL, TEMPERATURE_PARAMS, RAIN_PARAMS

| Variable           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `WEATHER_API_URL`  | URL of the weather API. Ensure that this environment variable is set to the appropriate URL. |
| `TEMPERATURE_PARAMS`  | List of parameters passed to the URL of the weather API when querying the temperature endpoint. |
| `RAIN_PARAMS`  | List of parameters passed to the URL of the weather API when querying the rain endpoint. |

```bash
export WEATHER_API_URL = {value} 
export TEMPERATURE_PARAMS = {value}
export RAIN_PARAMS = {value}
```

## üîß Running the Tests <a name = "tests"></a>

The tests for this project verify that the response is 200, that it has all expected parameters, and the performance.

### How to Test

1. Set up the temporary env variable PYTHONPATH 

```bash
export PYTHONPATH = path/to/project
```
2. Run the tests.
```bash
pytest
```

## üéà Endpoints <a name="endpoints"></a>

The usage of the system is pretty simple. The weather app has two different endpoints:

- `/temperature`: This endpoint retrieves the temperature forecast for a specified city. It returns the forecast for the next 3 days, including the maximum and minimum temperatures, apparent temperatures, sunrise and sunset times, and a description of the weather conditions.
  - It can optionally receive the `?city=` parameter in the URL. In this case, the city needs to be in the list configured in the `cities.json`. The default value is Lisbon. 
  - It can optionally receive the `?days=` parameter in the URL. It cannot be greater than 7, and the default value is 0, which returns the weather of 3 days from now.
- `/rain`: This endpoint checks if it will rain in a specified city in the next 3 days. It returns information about rainfall, including the sum of rain and showers, precipitation probability, and maximum wind speed.
  - It can optionally receive the `?city=` parameter in the URL. In this case, the city needs to be in the list configured in the `cities.json`. The default value is Lisbon.
  - It can optionally receive the `?days=` parameter in the URL. It cannot be greater than 7, and the default value is 0, which returns the weather of 3 days from now.


## üöÄ Running the App <a name = "running"></a>

Running the app only requires executing the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
python main.py
```

Alternatively, it can run using the Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t rm-weather --build-arg WEATHER_API_URL=$WEATHER_API_URL --build-arg TEMPERATURE_PARAMS=$TEMPERATURE_PARAMS --build-arg RAIN_PARAMS=$RAIN_PARAMS .

docker run -p 8000:8000 rm-weather
```
